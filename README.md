## Implementation Problems

### Solved Problems:

1. **A_Beautiful_Matrix.java** - Codeforces Problem
   - Calculates minimum moves to center the '1' in a 5x5 matrix
   - Time Complexity: O(1)

2. **A_Bit.java** - Codeforces Problem  
   - Simulates increment/decrement operations on variable X
   - Time Complexity: O(n)

3. **A_Chewbacca_and_Number.java** - Codeforces Problem
   - Minimizes a number by inverting digits (except leading digit to 0)
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
